They’ve already been found in placentas, bloodstreams, reproductive organs, and even the human brain.<br/><br/>Every year, we throw away over 40 billion plastic toothpaste tubes and toothbrushes. Almost none of them are economically or technically recyclable, and they mostly end up in landfills or our oceans.<br/><br/>In the Netherlands, do we recycle them in the plastic bin? We throw them in the plastic bin.

Buyers can then place <strong>anonymous bids</strong>. If you receive a price that you’re happy with, you can <strong>accept the buyer’s offer</strong>.</p><p>For every bid you receive, you will get an <strong>email notification</strong>. Once you accept a bid, the buyer has <strong>24 hours</strong> to complete the payment. The <strong>payment is processed through Broccoli</strong> and is transferred directly to your <strong>bank account</strong> (minus Broccoli’s <strong>transaction fee of 2.5%, with a maximum of €1,250</strong>), as registered in your user profile on the platform.</p><p>⚠ <strong>Important:</strong> <strong>During a sharefunding round, trading between investors is not allowed.</strong></p>"

            "answer": "<p><strong>HOW CAN I GENERATE RETURNS?</strong></p><p>By becoming a <strong>co-owner</strong> of a company, there are <strong>two ways</strong> to generate returns:</p><p>1. <strong>Dividend payouts (profit distribution)</strong></p><p>2.<strong>The value of your share certificate</strong>, which is determined by the difference between the <strong>purchase price</strong> and the <strong>selling price</strong> of your certificates.</p><p>The exact <strong>return on investment</strong> cannot be predicted with certainty. You are investing in Smyle at a <strong>relatively early stage</strong>—the foundation is strong, but real growth is now accelerating. If value is added to the company, it will directly impact <strong>revenue and results</strong>, which in turn affects the value of the <strong>current share certificates</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>forecast</strong> suggests that revenue will <strong>almost double</strong> within the coming years. This <strong>could mean</strong> that the value of your investment also <strong>doubles</strong>. However, this is a <strong>projection, not a guarantee</strong> for the future. Returns could be <strong>realized</strong> by selling your certificates on the marketplace or if <strong>Smyle (partially) sells to a third party</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>dividend amount</strong> is determined <strong>annually</strong> after the financial statements are finalized. The <strong>board</strong> decides whether the profit will be <strong>distributed as dividends</strong> or <strong>reinvested</strong>. Because Smyle is still in a <strong>growth phase</strong> together with you as co-owners, <strong>estimating the expected dividend return for the next three years is difficult</strong>.</p>"
