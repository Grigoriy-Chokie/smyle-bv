Send your request to hello@wesmyle.com and we'll send it to you.<br/><br/>The Smyle eBrush received a score of 1.5 from the German consumer testing institute Testsieger.</p><p>That means EXCELLENT (DE: SEHR GUT)!</p><p>This is the highest score an eBrush can achieve.

They found that the amount of fluoride released is equal to or more than the ammount in 'normal' toothpaste. We use the optimal 1450 parts fluoride per million. Check the report <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sj9LxvRdQcQT9UfkyifABBsT59bE9hI8/edit\"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>A free fluoride level – say, the extent to which the fluoride is actually released in your mouth – of above 1000-1200 ppm is considered adequate and significant. This can also be found in the literature. See also <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007868.pub2/abstract\"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>The effect of fluoride is further enhanced by innovative hydroxyapatite. This protects just like fluoride, but it is a natural material of the teeth. In addition, it closes the 'dental tubules' (small channels) to your nerves, so that there is less chance of sensitive teeth. It also has a whitening effect.
